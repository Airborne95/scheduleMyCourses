# webappDegreePlanning


**This project is a work in progress**

### Progress
Thus far web-crawler and web-scraper were developed to test basic functionality. The previously mentioned files were developed rapidly and require refinement before collaborates will be brought on.

### Context
This is a web-app for university students. Because courses are offered at particular times in the year and course availability can change, finding the right set of courses to take becomes difficult, tedius and reptitive with the exisitng set of tools. This web-app will allow students to view different options at a glance and forecast how a certain set of courses will impact their future semester.

### Learning Outcomes
This project will give experience to full-stack development.
